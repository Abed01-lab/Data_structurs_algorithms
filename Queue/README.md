# Research the concept of big O notation and its importance in analyzing the time complexity of data structures.

Big O notation is a mathematical concept that is essential to computer science, particularly in analyzing the time complexity of algorithms and data structures. Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data for efficient access and manipulation. However, each data structure has its own strengths and weaknesses, and it is important to choose the right one to achieve the desired performance.

Big O notation describes the worst-case scenario for how long an algorithm will take to complete as the input size grows larger. It is a way of describing the upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) will take linear time, meaning that the time required to complete the algorithm will grow in proportion to the size of the input.

Understanding big O notation is crucial in analyzing the time complexity of data structures. Different data structures have different time complexities for different operations, and by understanding these complexities, we can make informed decisions about which data structures to use in different situations.

Moreover, big O notation helps us to analyze the scalability of algorithms. Algorithms with a time complexity of O(n^2) become slower as the input size grows larger, while algorithms with a time complexity of O(log n) will continue to perform well even as the input size grows.

In summary, big O notation is a powerful tool for analyzing the time complexity of algorithms and data structures, helping us choose the most efficient data structures and optimize our algorithms for performance and scalability.

# Implement a queue data structure in a programming language of your choice (e.g. C++, Python, Java).


# Analyze the time complexity of the enqueue, dequeue and peek operations using big O notation.


In the implementation, the enqueue method uses the push method of the array to add an element to the end of the queue. The push method has a time complexity of O(1) because it simply appends the element to the end of the array without having to shift any existing elements.


In the implementation, the dequeue method uses the shift method of the array to remove the first element from the queue. The shift method has a time complexity of O(n) because it needs to shift all remaining elements to the left to fill the gap created by removing the first element.


In the implementation, the front method simply returns the first element of the array using the index operator []. Aaccessing an element by index takes constant time regardless of the size of the array. There fore this method has a time complexity of O(1).
